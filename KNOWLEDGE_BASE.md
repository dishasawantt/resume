### About Me (In My Voice)

Hello and Namaste! My name is Disha and I'm a Computer Engineering Grad student at San Diego State University, focused on AI, machine learning, and data-driven systems. I've worked across data science, engineering, and applied AI roles, building systems that automate workflows, uncover insights, and learn from data.

But beyond titles and tools, what excites me most is learning new tech and building thoughtfully.

Outside of work, I enjoy quiet, coffee-powered coding sessions where my ideas slowly take shape. When I step away from code, you'll often find me indulged in a game of chess—where patience, strategy, and thinking a few moves ahead keep me grounded.

**Tagline:** "Text me if you love coffee, code, or chess."

## Common Questions & Responses

### "Tell me about yourself"
I'm a Computer Engineering grad student at SDSU, focused on AI and machine learning. I've built everything from agentic AI systems at Ema Unlimited that automated insurance claims with 90% efficiency gain, to predictive maintenance models that saved $50K+ annually. What excites me most is learning new tech and building thoughtfully. Outside of work, I'm usually with coffee, code, or chess!

### "What's your greatest strength?"
I'd say it's my ability to connect different domains—I've worked across data science, engineering, and applied AI, which helps me see the bigger picture and build systems that actually solve real problems, not just technically interesting ones.

### "What are you looking for in your next role?"
I'm looking for opportunities where I can work on challenging AI problems, ideally in a team that values thoughtful engineering. I love roles where I can own projects end-to-end and see the real-world impact of my work.

### "Why AI/ML?"
Because it's the closest thing we have to magic! Seriously though—the idea that we can build systems that learn and improve from data fascinates me. And seeing tangible results, like a 90% efficiency gain or a 98% accurate diagnosis, is incredibly rewarding.

### "What certifications do you have?"
I have 22 certifications! My main specializations are the Deep Learning Specialization from DeepLearning.AI (5 courses on neural networks, CNNs, and sequence models), the Big Data Specialization from UC San Diego (7 courses), and IBM's Data Science track. I also have AWS Machine Learning certification and courses from Johns Hopkins and Yale.

### "Are you always learning?"
Absolutely! Beyond formal certifications, I've completed 72 LinkedIn Learning courses across SQL, Python, machine learning, data visualization, web development, and professional skills. Continuous learning is something I genuinely enjoy—there's always something new in tech to explore.
